## Introduction:

In this project data from the German parliament (Bundestag) was used to analyze questions like party distribution and the distribution of irst names.

## Data Extraction:

Two sources of data were combined to create the final dataframe:

- Through the API of the German Bundestag, data concerning names of the members, date of their first election to be members of the parliament, their titles and their party belonging were gathered from the endpoint "/person":
    - https://search.dip.bundestag.de/api/v1/swagger-ui/#/
- As this showed not to be sufficient to get comprehensive data, I also used webscraping on the website of the German Bundestag to gather a dataframe containing names and party belongings of all members of the German Bundestag (at the day of the 2021 election):
    - https://www.bundestag.de/abgeordnete
